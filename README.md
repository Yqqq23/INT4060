# Linear Algebra Lab – Interactive Learning Environment

![Demo Screenshot](demo.png)

**Linear Algebra Lab** is an interactive web-based learning project designed to help students intuitively understand core concepts in linear algebra through visualization and experimentation. Instead of focusing only on symbolic manipulation, this project emphasizes conceptual understanding by allowing users to interact with vectors, matrices, and transformations in real time.

## About the Creator

I'm Yunqi Wang, a final-year student majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Educational Technology.  
I'm an aspiring educator and researcher who is passionate about human-inspired AI and its potential to support learning and wellbeing.   I enjoy exploring how technology can better understand people, how we think, feel, and grow, and turning those insights into tools that are practical, ethical, and learner-centered.   With strong communication skills and a genuine love for teaching, I aim to create engaging learning experiences where students feel supported, curious, and confident.

## Project Overview

Linear algebra is foundational for modern fields such as machine learning, computer graphics, robotics, and data science, yet many learners struggle because the subject is often taught abstractly. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing:

- visual explanations of abstract concepts  
- interactive manipulation of mathematical objects  
- experiential learning before formal theory  
- intuitive understanding of how matrices operate in space

## Learning Design Philosophy

We follow Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, a proven educational framework that emphasizes learning through experience and reflection.

David Kolb's theory proposes that learning is most effective when it follows a four-stage cycle: experiencing concrete situations, observing and reflecting on those experiences, forming abstract concepts, and actively experimenting with new ideas. This hands-on approach helps learners build deep and lasting understanding.

In this project, interactive visual exploration comes first, followed by guided observation, conceptual explanation, and opportunities for experimentation, allowing learners to construct knowledge through action rather than passive memorization.
